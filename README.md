## MP3\-IP


</div>

### Description

I thought that I would submit this as a laugh. It was designed to control audio on another pc remotely via the office network. If you have a server in your office that is connected to an audio system of some kind then this could be for you, it allows multiple connections to the server side application and is very easy to use. Unfortunatly there is no MP3 control, that function still hasn't been added. But playing CD's remotely is fun. The client socket is controlled via an .INI file. Have a go and please rate and comment on it :)
